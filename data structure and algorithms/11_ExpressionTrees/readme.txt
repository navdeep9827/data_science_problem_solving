README for Expression Tree Evaluation

This repository contains Python code for building and evaluating expression trees. Expression trees are a data structure commonly used in mathematics and computer science to represent and evaluate mathematical expressions. The code provided in this repository allows you to create an expression tree from an infix mathematical expression and evaluate the result.

Code Components
The code consists of two primary components:

Node Class
The Node class represents a node in the expression tree. Each node has a value, a left child, and a right child. The value of a node can be an operator (e.g., "+", "-", "*", "/") or a numeric operand.

build_expression_tree(expression) Function
The build_expression_tree function takes an infix mathematical expression as input and returns the root of an expression tree. Here's how the function works:

Tokenization: The input expression is tokenized, splitting it into individual tokens. Tokens can be numeric values, operators, or parentheses.

Conversion to Postfix Notation: The function converts the infix expression into postfix notation. This is done to facilitate the construction of the expression tree. The postfix notation ensures that the order of operations is clear.

Expression Tree Construction: The function constructs the expression tree using a stack data structure. It iterates through the postfix tokens and builds the tree accordingly.

evaluate_expression_tree(root) Function
The evaluate_expression_tree function takes the root of an expression tree as input and returns the result of evaluating the mathematical expression.

Tree Traversal: The function recursively traverses the expression tree. It evaluates the left and right subtrees and performs the operation specified by the operator at the current node.

Operator Evaluation: The function supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Division by zero is handled, and the result is returned as an integer.

How to Use
To use this code, you can follow these steps:

Create a Python script and include the code provided.

Call the build_expression_tree function with your infix mathematical expression as an argument. This function will return the root of the expression tree.

Call the evaluate_expression_tree function with the root of the expression tree obtained from step 2. This function will return the result of evaluating the expression.
