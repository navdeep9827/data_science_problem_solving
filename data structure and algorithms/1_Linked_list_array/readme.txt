Stack ADT implementation using Arrays

Introduction:

This exercise is a hands-on component for the concepts of Stack ADT.
This introduces you to the Abstraction concept and how a data structure and its operations can be
created according to the requirements.
Expected Functionality:
This exercise requires you to implement Stack Abstract Data type in Python. You should create
Stack using Arrays (Lists in Python) and write the code for required operations as asked. The
goal of this exercise is to make you familiar with Abstraction and several operations written
within.

__init__() - The constructor for the Stack class initializing the required structure.
push(item) - This function should be able to push an item in the stack.
pop() - This function should remove the topmost element in the stack and return it.
top() - This function should return the topmost element in the stack.
isEmpty() - This function should return whether the stack is empty or not.
size() - This function should return the size of the stack.
