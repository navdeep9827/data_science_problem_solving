Python Classes: evaluate_postfix_expression and QueueUsingArrays
This repository contains two Python classes:

evaluate_postfix_expression: This class allows you to evaluate postfix expressions using a stack data structure.

QueueUsingArrays: This class implements a queue using arrays with essential queue operations like enqueue, dequeue, isEmpty, isFull, peek, and size.

Class: evaluate_postfix_expression
Usage
To use the evaluate_postfix_expression class, you need to pass a postfix expression and a stack as arguments. The class evaluates the expression and returns the result.

Methods
evaluate_postfix_expression(postfix_expression, stack): Evaluates a postfix expression and returns the result.
Class: QueueUsingArrays
Usage
To use the QueueUsingArrays class, you can create an instance of this class to work with queues implemented using arrays.

Methods
enqueue(data): Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
dequeue(): Removes an element from the front of the queue.
isEmpty(): Checks if the queue is empty.
isFull(): Checks if the queue is full.
peek(): Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
size(): Returns the current size of the queue.
