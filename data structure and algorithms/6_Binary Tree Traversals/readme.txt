Binary Tree Traversals
This Python script provides two functions to traverse a binary tree:

Consecutive Parent-Child Numbers

This function, consecutiveNodes(root), calculates the number of parent-child pairs in a binary tree where the parent and child are consecutive numbers (i.e., parent = child - 1). It uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree.

Input: A binary tree with nodes.
Output: The count of parent-child pairs that are consecutive numbers.
Reverse Level Order Traversal

This function, reverseLevelOrder(root), performs a reverse level-order traversal of a binary tree, starting from the bottommost level, traversing from left to right, and moving up to the root.

Input: A binary tree with nodes.
Output: The list of values in reverse level-order.
Binary Tree Nodes
The code utilizes a simple Node class for creating nodes in the binary tree.

Feel free to use these functions and the Node class to work with binary trees in your Python projects. You can create your binary tree structure and test these functions with your data.
