Overview
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order. In this implementation, a linked list is used to create a stack data structure. The code provides essential stack operations, including push, pop, size, top, isEmpty, and reverse.

Usage:
To use this linked list stack, you need to create an instance of the LinkedListStack class. You can then perform stack operations using the methods provided by the class.

Methods
push(data): Adds a new element to the top of the stack.
pop(): Removes and returns the element at the top of the stack.
size(): Returns the current size of the stack.
top(): Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
isEmpty(): Returns True if the stack is empty, False otherwise.
reverseList(): Reverses the stack.
printStack(): Prints the elements of the stack.
