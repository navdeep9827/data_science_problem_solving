# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

## Overview
This Python script demonstrates the implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in machine learning and data analysis to identify and capture the most important features in a dataset.

## How PCA Works
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The input data should be organized as a matrix where rows represent samples and columns represent features.

2. **Standardization (Optional):**
   - Standardize the data if features are on different scales.

3. **Covariance Matrix:**
   - Compute the covariance matrix of the standardized data.

4. **Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Calculation:**
   - Compute the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of the covariance matrix.

5. **Select Principal Components:**
   - Sort the eigenvalues in descending order and select the top k eigenvectors as the principal components.

6. **Transform Data:**
   - Project the original data onto the subspace formed by the selected principal components.

# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Code

## Overview
This Python script demonstrates the implementation of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). SVD is a matrix factorization technique that decomposes a matrix into three other matrices, enabling various applications in linear algebra, signal processing, and dimensionality reduction.

## How SVD Works
1. **Matrix Decomposition:**
   - SVD decomposes a matrix A into three matrices: \(A = U \Sigma V^T\), where \(U\) and \(V\) are orthogonal matrices, and \(\Sigma\) is a diagonal matrix with singular values.

2. **Singular Values:**
   - Singular values in \(\Sigma\) represent the importance of corresponding singular vectors in the original matrix.

3. **Reduced SVD:**
   - In practice, for high-dimensional data, a reduced form of SVD is often used where only the top k singular values and corresponding vectors are considered.

4. **Applications:**
   - SVD is widely used for dimensionality reduction, noise reduction, and collaborative filtering in recommendation systems.
